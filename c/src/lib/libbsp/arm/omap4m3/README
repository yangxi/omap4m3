RTEMS BSP for Dual Cortex-M3 MPU subsystem of OMAP44xx SoC.

OMAP44xx has two Cortex-A9 Cores and two Cortex-M3 Cores. Dual
M3 cores are cache coherent and share the memory, but they are not
cache coherent with A9 Cores. A9 cores and M3 cores are sharing the
DRAM and can communicate via bus with each other.

This BSP supports dual M3 cores and could run in smp configuration.

Linux which is running on A9 cores could load/unload RTEMS images
to M3 cores via remoteproc framework. It will also create a logging
file to keep RTEMS's terminal output.

To play this BSP, you have to have:

1)Linux with remoteproc support for OMAP4. You can downloand 
the linux from at git://github.com/GAnthony/upstream-rpmsg.git
(upstream_rpmsg branch)

*)Linux module to unload/unload image to M3 cores. You can find
one example at c/src/lib/libbsp/arm/omap4m3/module/rproc.c

Instructions to run RTEMS.
*)Copying the RTEMS image such as hello.exe to to /lib/firmware/ducati-m3-core0.xem3.
*)loading /lib/firmware/ducati-m3-core0.xem3 to the first Cortex-M3 core by loading rproc module.
*)RTEMS's terminal will be directed to /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/omap-rproc.1/trace0.
*)Unloading rproc module will shutdown remote M3 cores.
