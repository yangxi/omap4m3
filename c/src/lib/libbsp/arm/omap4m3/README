RTMES on Cortex-M3 subsystem of OMAP4 SoC

This BSP is developed for running RTEMS on OMAP4's M3 cores.
The RTEMS image is loaded by Linux via remoteproc framework. 

For running this BSP, you need
*)Linux with remoteproc support for OMAP4. You can downloand 
the linux from upstream_rpmsg branch at git://github.com/GAnthony/upstream-rpmsg.git
*)Linux modules to load/unload RTEMS. 
An example is at c/src/lib/libbsp/arm/omap4m3/module/rproc.c

Instructions to run RTEMS.
*)Copying the RTEMS image, for example, hello.exe to  to /lib/firmware/ducati-m3-core0.xem3.
*)loading /lib/firmware/ducati-m3-core0.xem3 to the first Cortex-M3 core by loading rproc module.
*)RTEMS's terminal is directed to /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/omap-rproc.1/trace0.
